- secret scanning and release validation.

## v0.2 beta

- improve Windows and macOS install checks;
- add provider connector test harness documentation;
- add local subscription-cost model for flat-plan SaaS spend;
- improve dashboard risk scoring;

- add more redaction tests around provider payloads and notification output.

## v0.3

- more complete provider redaction test suite;
- documented PR review automation pattern;
- optional local-only scheduler;
- expanded dashboard export formats;

## Not planned

MoneySiren does not plan to add:

- persistence of raw provider payloads;
- upload of local AI CLI logs to a remote service;
- public demos using real account data;
- screenshots containing live billing details or organization identifiers.

## Maintainer priorities

MoneySiren prioritizes:

1. Local-first safety.
2. Read-only provider access.
3. Inspectable normalized data.
4. Fake fixtures and reproducible review.
5. Clear install paths for individual developers and small teams.
6. Codex-friendly maintenance workflows.
