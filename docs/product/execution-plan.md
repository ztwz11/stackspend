# StackSpend v0.1 Implementation Plan

> **For Hermes/Codex:** Use controlled, slice-by-slice implementation. Keep product artifacts inside this repository. Do not modify `auto-driver` for product files.

**Goal:** Build a local-first, CLI-first cloud/SaaS usage, status, and expected billing dashboard for individual developers and small teams.

**Architecture:** TypeScript pnpm monorepo with a CLI app, a local Next.js dashboard, shared core/config/db/security/report packages, and read-only provider connectors. SQLite is the default local persistence layer; raw provider payloads are redacted and normalized before storage.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, pnpm, Vitest, SQLite, Next.js, Node.js, Slack webhook.

## Global Repository Boundary

- Product repo: `stackspend`.
- Automation repo: `auto-driver`.
- Product files must not be created in `auto-driver`.
- `auto-driver` should ideally remain clean during StackSpend implementation.

## M0 — Product planning and spec lock

Goal: establish the product scope, security posture, repo rules, and implementation plan.

Files:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `.gitignore`
- `.env.example`
- `LICENSE`
- `docs/product/dossier.md`
- `docs/product/decision-log.md`
- `docs/product/execution-plan.md`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/security.md`
- `docs/providers/aws.md`

- `docs/providers/cloudflare.md`

Completion criteria:

- v0.1 scope and out-of-scope are explicit.
- security rules are explicit.
- provider docs identify permissions, data surfaces, and risks.
- implementation is not started yet.
