## Validation

Run before application. In this repository, the npm scripts call the repo-local
`corepack pnpm` wrapper used on Windows:

```bash
npm run test
npm run typecheck
git diff --check
npm run secret:scan
npm run secret:scan:all
```

Record results:

```text
npm run test:             PASS, 18 of 19 workspace projects
npm run typecheck:        PASS, 18 of 19 workspace projects
git diff --check:         PASS
npm run secret:scan:      PASS, 453 files checked
npm run secret:scan:all:  PASS, 453 files checked and git history checked
```

## Application answer checks

- [ ] The application says the project is MIT-licensed.
- [ ] The application says the project is local-first.
- [ ] The application says provider connectors are read-only.
- [ ] The application says raw provider payloads and credential material are not persisted.
- [ ] The application says the project is early and actively maintained.
- [ ] The application explains exactly how Codex will be used.
- [ ] API credits, if requested, are tied to PR review, maintainer automation, or release workflow experiments.
