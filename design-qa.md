**Findings**
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual mismatches remain for the implemented 864px desktop state.
  Location: dashboard overview and connections screens.
  Evidence: source image uses a 164px left rail, compact header, four KPI cards, service/connection segmented control, tall dense bordered service table, and flat connection cards. Current captures at `.tmp/overview-864.png` and `.tmp/connections-864.png` now use the same left-rail width, compact Segoe-style type scale, low-contrast borders, dark teal active states, four KPI cards, segmented service/connection control, reference-height table frame, and provider connection cards with compact one-line credential controls and setup links.
  Impact: the main layout, typography rhythm, and visual density now match the reference direction closely.
  Fix: no blocking fix required.

**Open Questions**
- The reference image is populated with sample services and saved credentials; this local capture is an empty-state dashboard because no local StackSpend data is saved. That content mismatch is expected for the current runtime state.
- Provider marks now use downloaded local SVG assets from `apps/web/public/provider-icons/`. The assets were generated with `C:\Users\chunjae\Downloads\brand-svg-icon-pack-builder\icon-pack-builder\download-icons.mjs`.

**Implementation Checklist**
- Left navigation converted to compact icon rail with reference-like dark teal active state.
- Dashboard overview changed to reference-like header, four KPI cards, service/connection segmented control, and compact service table.
- Connections screen changed to compact provider cards with title-line setup links and one-line credential controls.
- Grid stretch fixed so vertical spacing no longer expands across the viewport.
- Locale labels updated so overview displays as Dashboard / 대시보드 / ダッシュボード.
- Brand mark switched to a connected-node icon closer to the reference source.
- Provider text chips replaced with local downloaded SVG icons for all catalog services covered by `services.json`.

**Follow-up Polish**
- Add approved first-party provider logo assets if exact vendor-distributed SVG files become required.
- Add a seeded demo fixture route if screenshots must visually match the populated reference data state.

full-view comparison evidence: reference image viewed with `view_image`; implementation captured with Playwright Firefox Node API.
focused region comparison evidence: dashboard left rail, KPI row, segmented control/table area, and connection card header/body were checked in the final screenshots.
patches made since previous QA pass: left-align content; remove overview database notice; fix grid vertical stretch; compact long KPI values; make connection setup links inline; update overview title labels; add reference-height empty table frame; compress connection credential rows; switch brand mark to connected-node icon; replace provider text chips with downloaded local SVG brand icons; add catalog-card icons for planned and research services.
final result: passed
